# Stroke-Prevention-Analysis

This repository contains this analysis used to overcome the death rate due to stroke based on influencing factors and stroke prevention strategies. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle with the dataset name "Stroke Prediction Dataset". The dataset uses the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data.

## Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to identify the key factors influencing stroke occurrence and develop effective strategies for stroke prevention. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to provide insights that can help reduce the death rate due to stroke.

## Problem Statement
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Understanding the factors that contribute to stroke and developing prevention strategies is crucial for reducing the incidence and mortality rates associated with stroke. This project addresses this issue by analyzing a comprehensive dataset to identify risk factors and suggest prevention measures.

## Background
Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. Early identification of risk factors and timely intervention are essential for stroke prevention. This project leverages data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset that can inform prevention strategies.

## Project Output

The output of this project includes:
A cleaned and processed dataset ready for analysis.
Visualizations depicting the relationships between various factors and stroke occurrence.
Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to identify significant risk factors.
Recommendations for stroke prevention based on the analysis results.

## Methods
The project utilizes the following methods:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of the data to identify patterns and trends.
Statistical Analysis: Performing descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the data.
